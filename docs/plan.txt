Initial Planning:

General idea: COVID Dashboard that looks something like this: https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard

Required components:

Data infrastructure (how do we gather and store the information about covid?)
API (used for sending the covid information to the front end)
Logs (used for tracking interactions with both the front and back end)
Front end website (obviously used for interaction with the end user)

Tentative Schedule:
- Set up data collection storage (4/1)
- Set up SQL database(s) (4/6)
- Set up server/endpoints (4/8)
- Set up front end (4/18)

Possible features:
- Cases and death counts for NC
- Cases and death counts by county
- Graph of cases?
- Map of cases?
- User system

General roles of members:
- Brendan: Front end/database lead
- Hugo: Back end lead
- Kevin: Authentication lead
- Isaac: Communication lead
- William: Data lead
