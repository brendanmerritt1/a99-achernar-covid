Initial Planning:

General idea: COVID Dashboard that looks something like this: https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard

Required components:

Data infrastructure (how do we gather and store the information about covid?)
API (used for sending the covid information to the front end)
Logs (used for tracking interactions with both the front and back end)
Front end website (obviously used for interaction with the end user)

Tentative Schedule:
- Set up data collection storage (4/1)
- Set up SQL database(s) (4/6)
- Set up server/endpoints (4/8)
- Set up front end (4/18)
- Set up user authentication (4/25)

Possible features:
- Cases and death counts for NC
- Cases and death counts by county
- Graph of cases?
- Map of cases?
- User system

General roles of members:
- Brendan: Front end/database lead
- Hugo: Back end lead
- Kevin: Authentication lead
- Isaac: Communication lead
- William: Data lead

UPDATE 1 (4/1)
We have decided to plan and develop the front end first. This will make it easier to drive our back end development and data collection.
Brendan has begun work on building the basic HTML for the webpage. This will likely be done in the next couple days.
This means we will effectively flip the target completion dates for the front end and back end components

UPDATE 2 (4/7)
Front end design is more or less done.
Brendan and Hugo have begun to work on the back end. Brendan is working on the databases for the covid data, Hugo is working on the API endpoints.
William has found the data source for our data (NCDHHS) and will soon be done setting up what is necessary to gather the data

UPDATE 3 (4/18)
Front end and back end are mostly complete. It is now time to begin linking the two together
Kevin is almost done with the code for authentication, but has not yet integrated it yet with the existing code

UPDATE 4 (4/25)
All of the code more or less works, it is time to prepare the project for submission (i.e., meeting all of the requirements)
Isaac has begun work on beefing up the documentation
When the code is finalized, all members will record a demo video to submit in the final submission
